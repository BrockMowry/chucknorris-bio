                <h3>Who is Chuck Norris?</h3>

                    "Carlos Ray 'Chuck' Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist and actor.
                    He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and judo.
                    After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and later
                    founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do.
                    Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in martial arts.
                    Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the spy film The Wrecking Crew (1969).
                    Friend and fellow martial artist Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in Way of
                    the Dragon (1972).
                    While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested he take it seriously.
                    Norris took the starring role in the action film Breaker! Breaker! (1977), which turned a profit.
                    His second lead Good Guys Wear Black (1978) became a hit, and he soon became a popular action film
                    star." (2022)
